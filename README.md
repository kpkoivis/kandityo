This is my bachelor's thesis at the department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki.
It's in Finnish and it's about decision trees and their uses in decision support in the healthcare setting.
It is a work in progress.

The tktltiki2 LaTeX template that the kandi.tex file is based on is not of my writing but rather
is a common one for many theses and seminar papers written at the department of Computer Science
at the University of Helsinki. You can view the template here:
